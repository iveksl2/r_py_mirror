Both the R & Python data ecoystem are growing and have much to offer. 
This repository contains code snippets and language features within both python and R 
with the intent of accelerating the learning of 1 language with a background from the other. 
The intent of this repository is NOT to start a flame war. (or is it?)

Anyone can feel free to contribute in any capacity!
